# DE_high-dimensional

=========================

Differential Evolution for high dimensional optimization problem (Version 0.9.0) Data: 13-Apr-2015
See Publication here http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04676
Program can be ran on single and mutiple processors.
============================================
required libraries: MPI (Message Passing Interface), MKL (Math Kernal Library)
A single thread compilation of mkl leads to better efficiency. This is why I compiled using a single thread command.
======================
Compilation command: one should issue ./make command on linux to compile the code. However you should
alway make sure that the program refers to the right location of libraries.
